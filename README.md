> **oTree Self Template** is a modular framework containing a comprehensive collection of ready-to-use experimental applications built on [oTree](https://www.otree.org/).

It serves as a modular foundation for academic research, corporate behavioral testing, and other experimental studies — enabling rapid design, development, and deployment of diverse behavioral, economic, and decision-making experiments.

This template is ideal for researchers, developers, and practitioners who need a flexible yet robust oTree environment that can be easily customized for new projects.

## 📦 Overview

This project provides a **comprehensive collection of reusable oTree apps**, including:

- 🧩 **Donation with Rank** – donation experiment with participant ranking  
- 💹 **Investment Apps** – investment tasks with high/low risk options and endowment rules  
- 🛍️ **Shop Apps** – simulated market shopping and consumption behavior  
- 📝 **Survey & Demographics** – participant background and demographic data  
- ⚙️ **Real Effort Tasks (RET):**
  - Decoding Task (symbol translation)
  - Transcription Task (typing accuracy)
  - Algebraic Task (math/algebra problems)
  - Slot Machine Task (luck-based RET using probability logic)

Each app can be used independently or integrated into a multi-round experimental design with automated data flow and final payment calculation.
